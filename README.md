## Verify equations of motion
Given:

The lyapunov function is also given in 8.9 example:

In order to verify the equations of motion the equations need to match the given expression below:

Due to the problem not stating anything dealing with potential energy the lagrange equation is equal to kinetic energy. Using the kineitc energy and lagrange equationa and equaling it to Q will allow for the equations of motion to be derived below. 



Solving the partials will allow for the equation to match the expression that was given above. The code shows this with the matrix as it is given instead of just an M variable as done before. So the equation of motions that were derived matches the given expression for the problem and it is verfied in the code.
